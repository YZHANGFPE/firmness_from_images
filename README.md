# Learning frmness of the food from visual features

The learning problem that we are interested is to learn the firmness of the food from it visual feature. As a human being, we can tell the firmness of the food from its appearance most of the time. Although people use tactile feeling to confirm how hard the object is, the perception usually gives enough information. Even facing with a material that we have never encountered before, we are able to infer from our previous experience. The machine learning problem we are formulating here is similar to that process. From the training data which is a pair of firmness label and visual feature of a certain fruit or vegetable, a prediction model is obtained. The result is evaluated on a set of testing data. 

The data set consists of 43 categories of fruits and vegetables. (The  category here refers to the type of fruit and vegetable e.g. apple, orange, brocolli etc.) Each category has 10 â€“ 20 images acquired from Google image search.
